Timer App for Polaroid pack film.

This is a side project for a Polaroid timer for pack film.

The problem to solve is that trying to start a timer while also pulling pack film out of your camera is something that requires three hands, one for the timer, one to hold your camera, and another to pull the film out.

The solution is a timer app that has a pre-countdown, giving you time to put the phone down and use both hands for the camera and film.

UI is complete. See: https://github.com/MichaelCalleia/Peel-Now-Timer-App.wiki.git

Next step, finding a developer looking for a side project to work on thisâ€”if interested, message me.
